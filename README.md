### Fountain of Objects.cs
This is my implementation of the (in)famous Fountain of Objects challange from RB Whitaker's C# Player's Guide book, all with 6 expansion packs.
It is a console game in which the player navigates a grid of caverns, filled with monsters and traps, and searches for Fountain of Objects.
To win the game the player needs to find the Fountain, activate it, and return to the entrance, while avoiding the monsters and traps that are everywhere.
